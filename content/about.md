My journey presented many opportunities for me. It created lessons that might help people in need specifically the small MSMEs, Small Businesses & the Youth of today’s India.

Since then, I had the sincere chance to get associated with Brands like City Gold Tea, Haldiram Prabhuji, Gopaldhara Tea Estate, Krishyam Tea, Raymonds – Anmol Collections, Wealmag, Furnikraft and many more.
