The 9yr. old journey of Digital Marketing till date, itself was the greatest achivement altogather.

Working with people of different cultures, diffrent perspectives is such a life-learning lesson for me.

It always amaze me how ideas, experience, expertise & skillset from different people can build something awesomely beautiful.

Obviously though you do not study professional courses for Certificates, rather you study to learn the practical knowledge.

As you can see,
---------------

from my [About Sayan page](http://sayan.local/about-sayan/).. it was a long journey since then.. Which started well back in the early 2011s..

I was fortunate enough to be one of early Internet people, and leverage it to the fullest.

My First Certification,
-----------------------

One of my first certifications came along when I tried to customize my Blogger & WordPress Templates.

As I was one among the many non-tech guys, I did some research on how to achieve some more readable fonts.

One of the articles showed me to copy and paste some CSS code into my Blogger template, and it worked!

It arose a question in my mind, what if I could write the snippet myself.

As it stroke, I tried hard to find some very beginner friendly courses

And I found, SoloLearn.. And learnt about the basics of HTML and any webpage on the internet.

### In the meanwhile,

Life happend, and like everyone else I also quitted the FREE course, and learnt teachniques from other blogs as well.

### By 2015

I was well equipped to do WordPress Theme customizations myself. And also was able to build my own plugin as well.

### Well Life Happend,

And I got my first job in a local Call center, and also got somewhat detached to the whole Online thing.

My First Startup @ 2016
-----------------------

My first startup was a aimless website with more than 20 articles and a decent enough traffic to survive.

BUT,

The website was basically aimless, which posted on motivation, website traffic generation, web development and many more.

Basically, goat without head.

I started with learning more & more and as of now I strated emphesizing on setting a goal with my Startup.

Certainly down the road, I lost my motivation and the startup got lost in the whirl of the time

And then, Second Certification happend
--------------------------------------

When I was going through all those courses.

My second certification was achieved.

Next Certification was,
